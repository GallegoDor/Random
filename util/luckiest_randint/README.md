You choose a number, and the script finds the most commonly generated random integer within that numbers range.
The script determines this number after one hundred thousand times. So you might have to wait a few seconds.

Usage instructions:

>1. **cd** into the directory where the file is saved.

>2. run the file by typing **python most_common_randint.py**

>3. Wait for you results

-------------- **OPTIONAL** -------------------

If you're planning to use the script more than once (for accuracy purposes) you must clear the numbers.log file. Do so by:

4) **rm numbers.log**

5) type **clear**

6) restart from step #2
